						<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
						<div class="section-title-underline"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="section-content">
						<p class="italic">We were born out of the necessity to provide the new generations with authentic food that met their healthy and natural lifestyle. At Del Sur our mission became a simple one; we were motivated to breach the gap between old and new, by providing delectable goods that are modern, fun, and innovative but never lowering our standards on quality, health, and culture. We are continually expanding our market, growing by leaps and bounds. Our objective of being in every store across the nation is closer every day. We want to surprise people’s palates with authentic Hispanic products that contain a twist of modern flavors with traditional roots. We know that once they have a taste of Del Sur they will discover we are passionately natural.</p>

Our strong commitment for social responsibility enables us to partner with suppliers who share the same morals as we do.
